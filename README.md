## 📌 Project Overview
BankDB is a full-stack banking platform designed for secure and reliable financial management. This repository contains the **Cloud-Optimized version** of the application, configured to run with remote database clusters and production-ready environments.

### 🌐 Live Deployment
The application is fully hosted and accessible online:
👉 **[Live Demo on Render](https://flask-mysql-bank-project.onrender.com/)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Performance Note:** Initial loading may take 30-50 seconds because the application is hosted on Render's free tier, which requires a "spin-up" period after inactivity. The database is securely managed on **Aiven Console**.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture & Security

### 1. Cloud Database Integration
The system utilizes a remote **MySQL** instance designed in **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
- **Relational Integrity:** Strict use of Foreign Keys and constraints across 10+ tables.
- **Optimized Retrieval:** Extensive use of SQL Views (e.g., `accounts_balance`) to simplify complex data reporting for the web interface.

### 2. Security & Reliability
- **ACID Transactions:** All financial movements implement `start_transaction()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` to ensure data integrity in a cloud environment.
- **SQL Injection Protection:** 100% of database interactions utilize **Prepared Statements** to sanitize user input.
- **Production Configuration:** Environment variables are used to manage sensitive database credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`), ensuring security on the hosting platform.
